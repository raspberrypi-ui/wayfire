/**
 * name: scale-filter
 * on: output
 * when: This signal is sent from the scale plugin whenever it is updating the
 *   list of views to display, with the list of views to be displayed in
 *   views_shown. Plugins can move views to views_hidden to request them not to
 *   be displayed by scale.
 *
 * Note: it is an error to remove a view from views_shown without adding it to
 *   views_hidden; this will result in views rendered in wrong locations.
 *
 * If multiple plugins are connected to this signal, they are called in the
 * order defined by the logic in signal_provider_t; plugins should not depend
 * on being called in a predictable order. Specifically, plugins should not
 * expect views_hidden to be empty (and should not call clear() on it). It is OK
 * for a plugin to move a view from views_hidden to views_shown, but this will
 * likely not have predictable results.
